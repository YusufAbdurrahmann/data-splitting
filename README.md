# ✂️ Data Splitting – Learning Notes (By Yusuf Abdurrahman)

> *"Good splits make trustworthy models. Careful separation of data is key to fair evaluation."*

## 📘 What I Learned in Data Splitting

In this project, I explored how to split datasets effectively for machine learning tasks:

- **Train-Test Split**: Divide data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use multiple train/test splits to get a more reliable estimate of model accuracy.
- **Stratification**: Ensure balanced class distribution in splits, especially for imbalanced datasets.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Proper data splitting prevents data leakage and ensures fair model evaluation.
- Cross-validation provides a more robust performance estimate than a single split.
